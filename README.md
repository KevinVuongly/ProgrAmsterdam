# ProgrAmsterdam - Rush Hour
In this project we aim to find a programmable solution to solve the game named Rush Hour. This game is played on a grid/board. First of, we start with a 6 x 6 grid on which the game is played. Later versions of the game will include larger grids (9x9 and 12x12). On the grid there are cars and trucs. The cars take up 2 squares each and the trucks take up 3 squares each. Also all vehicles can only be moved within a straight line along the grid and they cannot be rotated. In this game the goal is to ride a red car out through the exit of the board. However there are other vehicles that obstruct the path which makes the puzzle harder. The goal is to move the vehicles around so that the exit path for the red car becomes clear and the red car can exit. 

For this project plan to use different algorithms, namely: 
- Breath-First Search Algorithm
- Depth-First Search Algorithm
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- A* Algorithm
